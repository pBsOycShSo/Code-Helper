It's helping to code your programs and it's easy to use. Try it.

## Installation :
It's just like a normal software. You can install it as normally.

## Usage :

```
key,<short form>,<something you want to type>
```
### Just like this
      
```text
key,im,import
key,),);
key,fr,from
key,pr,print
key,cl,class
key,sop,System.out.print("
key,sopl,System.out.println("
key,sr,System.in.read(
key,psvm,public static void main(String args[]){
```
If you type this ```sop``` and after press space it will be changing to this ```System.out.print("```.
## After pressing start button it do like this :

```
If you need more, you can create your own.

Rules:
      [1] There must be "key" in the first.
      [2] It must be sort by a comma.

```
